Add files via upload
Run through stl_analyzer.py

modify input STL file name __name__ == "__main__" if statement, modify output xml file name if you wish. I have attached Part.STL and fuselage.xml for you to start testing and to have an initial idea of the proper coordinating system. 

keep in mind to create a cloned xfl file of your project to prevent unintentional crashes due to RAM unavailability. You can start with minimal number of sampling frequencies then manually tune them to reach a point of satisfactory to get refined aerodynamic results while sustaining bearable computational consumption level.

For any issues or suggestions please contact me via email: ysfabdulrahman1@gmail.com
